										<p>It is difficult to live day-to-day with Social Anxiety Disorder, an unfair condition that makes life more difficult than it has to be. We try to alleviate this with a social network designed to make our users comfortable in a follower-free, like-free, anonymous zone. No name, no status, no judgment.</p>

									<li>
										<span class="icon solid major style1 fa-code"></span>
										<h3>Anonymity</h3>
										<p>Our users are anonymous. No personal information: No real name, no profile picture, not even your location can be displayed. We do this, not to stifle individuality, but to grant users a safe space where they don't have to worry about being judged by their professional & personal lives. Users can trust that what they have to say will be more important than who they are outside of Juntos.  </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style3 fa-copy"></span>
										<h3>No Followers</h3>
										<p>Juntos users can not see the amount of followers another user has. We do this because we don't want users chasing popularity, or status through their number of followers. Similarly, we don't want users dictating who they engage with based on popularity. Our users value interactions, not numbers.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style5 fa-gem"></span>
										<h3>No Likes</h3>
										<p>Our users can not see the amount of likes a different user's post received. We do this, again, to hinder any popularity contests. The number of likes doesn't dictate whether someone's post was more meaningful than your own.</p>
									</li>

									<p>Social anxiety disorder is not nearly as addressed as it should be. <br />
									It can be difficult for those with this condition to find jobs, keep jobs, stay in school, or have a social life.</p>

								<ul class="statistics">
									<li class="style1">
										<span class="icon solid fa-code-branch"></span>
										<strong>15,000,000</strong> cases of SAD across the US

									<li class="style2">

								<p class="content"> Social anxiety disorder is the intense fear of being negatively judged, or rejected in a social situation. People with social anxiety disorder may deal with acting or appearing visibly anxious, which hinders their day-to-day lives. Symptoms include lack of eye contact, stumbling over words, a rapid heartbeat, and sweating which can make it downright uncomfortable to speak with others. Affecting 15 million Americans, SAD is the second most common anxiety disorder. We aim to connect & motivate these individuals that have a harder time creating new relationships in-person, by providing them with a platform that allows them to curate their social lives without feeling pressured or anxious. However, Juntos will not only be a social networking site where people can chat with one another as they wish, but will also host motivational speakers, and licensed therapists to help address user issues one-on-one. Here at Juntos, our customer’s mental wellbeing is our company’s top priority, which is why we cultivate a space where everyone can focus on their own personal interactions, and not have to worry about how they measure up against other members of this community.</p>
